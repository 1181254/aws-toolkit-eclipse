# TODO: It'd be nice to have this automatically configured based
#       on what platform we're running on.  We could probably do
#       that pretty easily with a little work in the Ant build
#       file.

# The localSourceCheckoutDir property allows you to override
# the source pulled from your repository and instead run the
# build using only local source.  Just point localSourceCheckoutDir
# to the root of a workspace where you have *all* of the plugins
# and features checked out.  Note that you can't just selectively
# override one of the plugins/features and pull the rest from your
# repository.
#
# TODO: The only tricky part is that our EC2 feature doesn't have the
#       ".feature" suffix in the feature ID like the tools look for,
#       so we need to symlink it to:
#           features/com.amazonaws.eclipse.ec2
#       in your local workspace in order for the build scripts to
#       correctly pick it up.
#
# localSourceCheckoutDir=/home/petrescu/Code/AwsToolkitSdk/workspace-eclipse-dev

# We also need to tell the build scripts where to find the Eclipse distribution
# to use during the build (to launch Eclipse in headless mode to run the build as
# well as pick up prebuilt plugins to satisfy our dependencies).  Right now we're
# pulling from CloudFront because it's fast, but obviously this could come from
# anywhere.  The platform distribution shouldn't make a huge difference but might
# need to be changed for different platforms.
